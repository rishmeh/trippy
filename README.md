Perfect 👍 I'll make you a clean **README.md** for your Vite + Vanilla JS canvas animation project, with instructions for building and deploying on **GitHub Pages**.

# 🎨 Canvas Animation with Vite (Vanilla JS)

An interactive canvas animation built with **Vanilla JavaScript** and bundled using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).  
The animation draws bouncing circles that connect with lines when close to each other, creating a trippy network effect.
